This repo is an example of how to set up Swagger documentation and a test to validate your specification against JSON Schema.

Have a look at the [Wiki](http://git.truecarcorp.com/jkreutzbender/swagger_documentation_rails/wiki) for full implementation details.

### Install Swagger-UI
```ruby
npm install
node_modules/.bin/bower install
bundle exec rake swagger:create
```

### Test Swagger Specification
```ruby
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/swagger_spec.rb 
```

### View Swagger-UI
```ruby
bundle exec rails s
```
Browse to [http://localhost:3000/internal/docs/]() and enjoy!

##Quick Start
If you want to get going ASAP this is all you need
1) Copy `bower.json` and `package.json` into the root of your project. Rename the project in `bower.json`.
2) Copy `lib/tasks/swagger.rake` into the same location in your project.
3) Copy `public/internal/docs_src/swagger-ui-index.html` into the same location in your project. Rename the project on line 5.
4) Add the needed route under internal
```ruby
scope '/internal' do
  get 'swagger' => "internal#swagger", constraints: { format: 'json' }
end
```  
And copy the code found in `app/controllers/internal_controller.rb` to your InternalController.
5) Create a `public/internal/docs_src/api.swagger.yaml` file. Follow the example provided here to start building out your documentation.
6) Add to your `.gitignore`
```ruby
# Ignore the npm and bower files
.cache
.config
.npm
bower_components
node_modules

# Generated by swagger:create rake task
/public/internal/docs
```
